# Changelog

All notable changes to OmniReview will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- 3 new MCP posting tools for cheaper model compatibility:
  - `post_review_summary` — post top-level MR summary comment
  - `post_inline_thread` — post inline discussion thread on exact diff line (auto-fetches SHAs, constructs position data)
  - `post_full_review` — combined: summary + all inline threads in one call
- Marketplace distribution format (`marketplace.json` + `plugins/omnireview/` subdirectory)
- CLAUDE.md for Claude Code development guidance
- 13 new tests for posting tools (56 total)

### Changed
- Restructured repo from flat layout to official Anthropic plugin marketplace format
- SKILL.md Phase 6 action commands now reference MCP posting tools (with bash fallback)
- MCP server now exposes 6 tools (was 3)
- Installation via `claude plugin marketplace add` + `claude plugin install`

### Fixed
- stdin inheritance bug: subprocesses no longer consume MCP JSON-RPC pipe (`stdin=DEVNULL`)
- Dependency resolution: `.mcp.json` uses `uv run --with mcp[cli]` instead of bare `python3`
- Missing `{SOURCE_BRANCH}`/`{TARGET_BRANCH}` placeholders in MR Analyst template
- `.gitignore` now covers `.venv/`, `.worktrees/`, `.DS_Store`

- 9-option post-review action menu with combined "Full review post"
- Summary comment template (MR overview format)

  - `create_review_worktrees` — atomic 3-worktree creation
  - `cleanup_review_worktrees` — reliable worktree cleanup
- Security-hardened subprocess execution (no shell injection)
- Input validation on all tool parameters
- Subprocess timeouts (30-120s)
- Large diff auto-truncation (10K line limit)
- "Small MR Trap" defense against skipping the full review process
